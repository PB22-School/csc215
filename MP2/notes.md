# Chapter 12

***programs should be broken down into blocks to simply the programming effort.***

The stack allows for a lot of function depths to be easily incorporated into our projects.

CR:				0D 		(character return)
LF:				0A 		(line feed)
CTRLZ: 		0A 		(operator interrupt)
RCONF:		1 			(read con to A)
WCONF:	2 			(write A to con)
RBOOT:		0 			(reboot cpm)
BDOS:		5 			(system call entry)
TPA:			100H	(transient program area)

Semicolons are comments
Programmers aren't humans

ED's line command works with negative numbers, and the Beginning command can also be negative (puts the cursor at the end.)

The 'K' command kills lines.
